## Install

### Security

This gem is [cryptographically signed](https://guides.rubygems.org/security/#using-gems) in order to assure it hasn't been tampered with. Unless already done, please add the author's public key as a trusted certificate now:

```
gem cert --add <(curl -Ls https://raw.github.com/svoop/airac/main/certs/svoop.pem)
```

### Bundler

Add the following to the <tt>Gemfile</tt> or <tt>gems.rb</tt> of your [Bundler](https://bundler.io) powered Ruby project:

```ruby
gem 'airac'
```

And then install the bundle:

```
bundle install --trust-policy MediumSecurity
```

## Usage

You can use this gem in your Ruby project:

```ruby
cycle = AIRAC::Cycle.new('2018-01-01')
cycle.date         # => #<Date: 2017-12-07>
cycle.effective    # => 2017-12-07 00:00:00 UTC..2018-01-03 23:59:59 UTC
cycle.id           # => 1713
(cycle + 5).id     # => 1804
(cycle - 5).id     # => 1708
```

The cycle can be formatted similar to `Date#strftime`, however, the placeholder `%i` represents the AIRAC cycle ID:

```ruby
cycle = AIRAC::Cycle.new('2018-01-01')
cycle.to_s                            # "1713 2017-12-07"
cycle.to_s("@%i as per %b %-d, %Y")   # => "@1713 as per Dec 7, 2017"
```

The current AIRAC cycle scheme started on 2015-06-25, therefore any calculation which leads to dates prior to inception will cause an error:

```ruby
(cycle - 100).id   # => ArgumentError
```

The `AIRAC::Cycle` class implements `Comparable` and its instances can safely be used s `Hash` keys.

If you prefer to do the math on the shell, the `airac` executable is your friend:

```shell
airac --help
```

## Development

To install the development dependencies and then run the test suite:

```
bundle install

bundle exec guard   # run tests whenever files are modified
```
